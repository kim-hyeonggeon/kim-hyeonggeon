# 🧬 Hi There

I'm Hyeong Geon Kim, a Biomedical Data Scientist at the University of Washington Virology Lab, blending data science, bioinformatics, and machine learning to drive impactful research in viral genomics and public health.

- Genomic Data Analysis ~ Managed end-to-end workflows for 30B+ sequencing reads, including QC, anomaly detection, and sponsor-ready reports.
- Machine Learning ~ Developed AI training datasets for biomedical image detection and segmentation.
- Dashboard Development ~ Built and deployed a modular HSV resistance dashboard in R Shiny with AWS integration.
- Research Contributions ~ Co-authored multiple peer-reviewed publications on viral genomics, phylogenetics, and diagnostic tools.

I am also a current Master's Student at the University of California - Berkeley School of Informatics working towards a MS in Information and Data Science. 
I'm currently working on a thesis/capstone but anticipate a graduation of May, 2026 so please feel free to reach out!

Things I've worked on:
- Statistics ~ A/B testing, Power Analysis, Statistical tests (Mann-Whitey U test, Chi square, logistic regression)
- Data Analysis ~ Graph Theory(Neo4j, Cypher), Data Storage(PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
- Machine Learning ~ Pytorch, Scikit-learn, Keras, ML model configurations(dropouts, learning rate), ML issue identification(Loss over time, Exploding/Vanishing Gradient)
- Data Engineering ~ AWS deployment(fastapi, nginx), Loadbalancing(Kubernetes), Version Control(Poetry, Docker, git), Caching(redis), Loadtesting(Istio, Grafana K6), CI/CD(Pytest, Minikube/Kubectl)
- Natural Language Processing ~ Transformer Architecture (T5), Encoder/Decoder (BERT, GPT3), Recurrent Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks

And learning more everyday...
